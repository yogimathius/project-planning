### What is a Project?

- work with a particular outcome
- can include a timeframe
- a set goal that needs to be worked towards
- includes timelines and resources
- needs resources allocated
- a desired mvp and a WAY to build out afterwards
- steps towards fulfilling a requirement

### What types of projects are there?

- hackathon projects
- launching new products
- personal/portfolio projects
- open source
- contract work
- DIY projects (at home, renos, etc)
- volunteer

### Project Management

#### Waterfall

- more "traditional" approach
- you quote and plan the project all at once and are set to that plan
- each piece is worked on one at a time to ultimately launch the project at once
- prone to roadblocks
- less flexible
- more solid initial planning

#### Agile

- agile is a philosophy
- iterative approach
- designed to provide continuous delivery of a product in smaller (faster) chunks
- each step of the way, the progress and plan are re-evaluated

#### Scrum

- Product Owner
- direct interface with stakeholders
- product manager
- Scrum Master
- Team leader
- Product Backlog (Roadmap)
- A living document, an ordered list of what is needed to improve the product
- defines the goals and work of the scrum team to reach the product goal
- Sprint Backlog
- The list of deliverables / tasks necessary to fulfill items in the product backlog
- Organized into groups that are deliverables within sprint-periods
- Sprint Planning
- what can be done during this sprint?
- how will this get done, and by whom?
- Set timeframe
- Sprint Execution
- no changes can be made that endeanger the sprint and its goals
- the quality of the product can not decrease
- complete upon the agree timeline, and all members are accountable and help each other
- Sprint Review
- All members of the team meet at expected intervals and look over the outcome of the sprint
- identify any adjustments or future developments that can improve over time
- identify in the development process that hindered, or helped developement
- Daily Scrum
- What we completed since yesterday
- What we're working on today
- If there's any blockers / tasks

#### Scrum Team

- Product Owner
- Developers a clear Product Goal
- Creates / Communicates Product backlog items
- ensures product backlog is transparent, visibile, and understood
- Scrum Master
- Coaches team members
- Help Scrum team focus on high-value increments
- Help remove roadblocks
- Ensure all Scrum take place within the time limits
- Help organize the project on all levels
- Developers
- Plan a backlog, and the upcoming sprint
- Finish anything they start to a launch-ready state
- Each day is planned toward reaching the current sprint goal

### Planning out a Project

#### Planning Steps

Feature Request: Implement a "User Profile Picture Upload"

**Step 1: Define User Stories**

1. As a user, I want to be able to upload a picture.
2. As a user, I want to see a preview of the uploaded picture before confirming.
3. As a user, I want the uploaded picture to be cropped and resized to a standard size.
4. As a user, I want to receive a confirmation message after successfully uploading a profile picture.
5. As a user, I want to see my uploaded profile picture on my page.

**Step 2: Identify Resources**

- FED
- Database
- BED
- UI/UX Designer / Product Team

**Step 3: Create an ERD**

- Entities: User
- Attributes: User ID, Username, Picture URL

**Step3.5: Setup Database**

**Step 4: Define Routes**

- `/profile` - view
- `/profile/edit` - edit

**Step 5: Create Wireframe**

- basic edit page, includes profile picture upload section and preview area

**Step 6: Setup Repo**

**Step 7: Project Structure and Naming Conventions**

- basic file structure for storing code implementation
- style guides
- tech stack

**Step 8: Workflow and Tasks**

**Step 9: Discuss method of communication**

- communication channels (slack, email, discord)
- how often to meet (daily scrum, weekly check-ins, office hours?)

### Keeping Track of Time

#### Time Estimation

- At the start this can be difficult... how do you know how long something will take???
- The best way to get better at giving estimates is to **track your time**
- Time tracking software
  - [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/)
  - [Tickspot](https://www.tickspot.com/)
- Consider the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) and/or use of an [online Pomodoro timer](https://pomofocus.io/)
- When quoting new projects you can review this to see how long on average these sorts of tasks have been taking (start date - end date = time to completion)
- give AT LEAST 10-20% buffer (blockers, bugs, design changes)

#### Have a schedule

- Protect work-time AND relaxation time
- You may wish book focus-hours in your calendar
- Avoiding distractions like social media etc. Email: it helps to have separate accounts for professional and personal emails.

### Staying Organized!!

#### Take notes!

- Meeting, planning, research... all opportunites to make a note for later
  - [EverNote](https://evernote.com/)
  - [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com)
  - [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/)
  - [Fireflies AI](https://fireflies.ai/)

#### Know your favorite documentation

- There are tools for grabbing main / trusted docs in one-place for your convenience like [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/)
